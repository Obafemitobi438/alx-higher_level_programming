Always use uppercase for the reserved keywords like SELECT and WHERE.

It is best to avoid the abbreviated keywords and use the full length ones where available (prefer ABSOLUTE to ABS).

Notice that SELECT, FROM, etc. are all right aligned while the actual column names and implementation-specific details are left aligned.

Although not exhaustive always include spaces:

before and after equals (=)
after commas (,)
surrounding apostrophes (') where not within parentheses or with a trailing comma or semicolon.
